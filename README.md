# Churn-Predictor-and-analyzer


Objectives: 
1. Scraped live reddit data to know what kind of views do people have on a particular product (here I used Verizon).

2. Modelled whether any given reddit user will leave verizon or stay with verizon; along with the reason so as to why the customer will leave.

 

In terms of Data Science what kind of tools I used:

1. Python - Entire ML pipeline was designed in here

2. SQL to view, edit, store and manage the dataset

3. LLM for automatically predicting the churn, augmenting the dataset as well

4. ML models: Both traditional and NLP based models

5. Evaluation metrics, Feature reduction all to optimize the ML models to work with any amount of data.
